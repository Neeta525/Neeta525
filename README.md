Hi, I'm Anita Chavez. I’m currently a digtal media engineeer. Part of my job is maintaining and updating our website. Learning full stack web development is going to help me improve the skills I have and help me become better at my job. Outside of work, I like to hit the trails on foot or on my MTN bike, soaking up the hot desert sun.
